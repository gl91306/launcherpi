# ![alt text](https://github.com/gl91306/launcherpi/blob/main/icon.png?raw=true) launcherpi 
Minecraft Launcher for Raspberry Pi computers.
# ALSO BIG THANKS TO KLOPIX FOR MS ACCOUNT TESTINGGG
Things that work:
 - Mojang accounts
 - Microsoft accounts
 - All versions from 1.5 to 1.18, excluding snaphots (Actually all the snapshots from 1.13 and above work, just not from 1.12 and below)
 - Forge. Every single forge version should work as well
 - Using a diffrent microsoft account to log in

Things that dont work:
 - Optifine (The standalone launcher, not the forge mod)
 - Fabric (and all its included mods)
 - Other non Forge/Fabric mod loaders and their mods
 - Standalone mods (eg LabyMod)
 - A settings menu (You cant change things like java path, args, ram, etc)
 - Multiple accounts (I made a system for these, but I dont have more than 1 accounts so i cant check)

Things that are untested:
 - Nothing
